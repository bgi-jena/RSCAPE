##  Function to properly evaluating the model based on the SCAPE estimated sensitivities. 
##  A straight forward evaluation of the SCAPE predictions e.g. via the RMSE or other error metrics are 
##  possible, these could be overoptimistic. The reason is that the time varying basal respiration is 
##  extracted as part of the original observations. Hence, a model that includes this part of the signal 
##  is hence comparing a fraction of the signal with itself. The evaluation wrapper uses the output of 
##  the getQ10 model and performs the evaluation based on the spectrally decomposed signals 
##  (i.e. in frequency ranges where Rb does not play a direct role), using the same spectral method, 
##  parameterization, and surrogate setting. Metrics used here are â€¦
